summary: >-
  These modules allow patients to text message photos via Penn Medicine’s Way to
  Health (W2H) platform directly into the EPIC electronic medical record.
  Currently, patients are offered the choice to submit their photos through
  myPennMedicine, our patient portal, or text message prior to teledermatology
  appointments. Patients receive text messages upon scheduling that instruct
  them to submit their photos. If they choose the text message option, they
  receive step-by-step guidance (with links to example images).
